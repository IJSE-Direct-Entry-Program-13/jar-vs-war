# Jar vs War
This project explores the differences between JAR (Java Archive) and WAR (Web Application Archive) files, covering their structure, use cases, deployment, and execution in Java applications. It includes practical examples demonstrating how each format is packaged, managed, and deployed in different environments. A valuable resource for understanding when to use JAR or WAR in software development.
